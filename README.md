# Popcorn Planner  
**Popcorn Planner** is a mobile-friendly web application that makes organizing movie nights with your friends fun and effortless.  

## Why This Project?  
Popcorn Planner was developed as part of **Le Wagon's bootcamp** in Lyon, France. Our goal was to build a fully functional app from scratch in just 10 days, as a team of three developers. This project highlights our ability to collaborate effectively under tight deadlines while leveraging modern web technologies.  

## Technologies Used  

We were free to experiment with various tools, but **Ruby on Rails** was the cornerstone framework of our development. Here's an overview of the technologies we used:  

### Frameworks:  
- **Ruby on Rails** – Backend logic and application framework  
- **Stimulus JS** – Lightweight JavaScript framework
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS framework

### Gems:  
- **Devise** – User authentication
- **pg_search** – Advanced search functionality  
- **Geocoder** – Geolocation and maps integration  

### APIs:  
- **TMDB (The Movie Database)** – To fetch movie data, including posters and descriptions  

## Main Features  

Despite the short timeframe, we successfully implemented the following core features:  
1. **Create a Group** – Bring your friends together to plan movie nights.  
2. **Organize Events** – Create events, propose movies for voting, and finalize the selection.  
3. **Vote for Movies** – Allow participants to vote on proposed movies for the event.  
4. **Event Management** – View details of upcoming and past events.  
5. **Movie History** – Keep track of the movies watched during past events.  

## Future Features  

Although our focus has now shifted to other portfolio projects, here are some exciting features we planned for the future:  
- **Movie Ratings and Comments** – Add ratings and share reviews after watching a movie.  
- **Event Recap Emails** – Send participants a summary of the next event, including details like date, time, and location.  

## Project Structure  

This project showcases key aspects of full-stack web development, including authentication, event management, voting systems, and API integration. It serves as a great example of what can be achieved in a collaborative and fast-paced development environment.
